               <p> <i> Grocery Store Access in King County </i> offers a visualization of the relationships
                  between grocery facilities throughout King County and a person's ability to access
                  them. Oftentimes, a person's accessibility for healthy food is limited by
                  whether or not they have access to transportation, or certain types of stores may be
                  located in more affluent areas. This project aims to demonstrate barriers that may prevent people
                  from accessing the resources they need.
               </p>
               <p> Through this project, users can explore the relationship between median household income and
                 grocery store locations, or whether an area has a great amount of people of color. considering
                 the oppression and injustices that Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) have experienced,
                 These may contribute to the lack of grocery stores present in certain areas. Additionally, users
                 also examine the relationship between public transit routes and grocery stores, to visualize a person's
                 ability to access a grocery store if they were to take the bus. However, it is important to consider the
                 time, distance, and mode of travel that people may need to know to better understand these relationships.
                 Unfortunately, under the time of this project was developed and the availability of data from the King
                 County GIS Open Data site, this information could not be determined at this time.
               </p>
               <p> This project does not encompass every existing grocery store in King County. Although
                 this information was taken from the King County GIS Open Data site, there were only about 200
                 entries for grocery stores, and was not reflective of every facility located in this region. As such,
                 the data was cleaned to grocery stores that would typically carry fresh produce, meat, dairy products,
                 and other food items a person may shop for. Convenience stores and pharmacies were also excluded, and
                 additional searches using Phantombuster, a data extraction site, was used with search terms of popular
                 stores in the area, such as "Fred Meyer", "Safeway", and "grocery". Obviously, this is not an exhaustive
                 list of those present, but this produced an additional number of stores needed for the purposes of this project.
               </p>
               <p> Inspiration for this project came from the <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/data/~/media/depts/health/data/documents/healthy-food-availability-report.ashx">Healthy
                  Food Availability and Food Bank Network Report</a> put out in February 2019. However, considering
                  there is very limited data on what the researchers define as "healthy" food, and other information
                  such as travel time to these locations, further work is needed to fully understand the implications
                  this visualization may have.
