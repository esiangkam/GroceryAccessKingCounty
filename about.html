               <p> Grocery Store Access in King County offers a visualization of the relationships
                  between grocery facilities throughout King County and a person's ability to access
                  them. Oftentimes, a person's accessibility for healthy food is limited by their
                  whether or not they have access to transportation, or certain types of stores may be
                  located in more affluent areas. This project attempts to allow users to come to explore
                  these relationships and come to their own conclusions.
               </p>
               <p> Inspiration for this project came from the <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/data/~/media/depts/health/data/documents/healthy-food-availability-report.ashx">Healthy
                  Food Availability and Food Bank Network Report</a> put out in February 2019. However, considering
                  there is very limited data on what the researchers define as "healthy" food, and other information
                  such as travel time to these locations, further work is needed to fully understand the implications
                  this visualization may have.

                  that allows users to conduct data extractions from web searches.
